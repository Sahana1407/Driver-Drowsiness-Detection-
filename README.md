# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-
This project is a real-time Driver Drowsiness Detection System built using OpenCV, dlib, and Python. It monitors a driver's facial landmarks through a webcam feed and alerts the driver if signs of drowsiness are detected — such as prolonged eye closure or yawning — helping reduce the risk of accidents caused by fatigue.
